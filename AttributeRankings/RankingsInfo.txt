Within this file, are the attribute rankings for the different roles
The attribute rankings are how each roles is scored, in order to create the different player scores
The defaultAttributeRankings text stores all the default attribute rankings that are used by the system
The currentAttributeRankings file contains all the current attribute rankings, which will be used in calculations

NOTE : I would advise leaving the defaultAttributeRankings file alone, however it can be redownloaded later

Changes can be directly made to the currentAttributeRankings file, alternatively you can change it using the CLI or GUI
The currentAttributeRankings can be reverted back to the default values through the CLI and GUI aswell
